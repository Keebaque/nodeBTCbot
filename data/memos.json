  "quantum": "A general purpose and stable high qubit quantum computer (which doesn't exist and no one is sure if will ever exist) can run an algorithm called shor's. Shor's is used to factor numbers.  You can thus use shor's to derive a private key from a public key. Bitcoin exposes public keys in the scenarios of certain address reuse and when certain transactions are sitting in the mempool, as well as very old 2009 era pay to pubkey coinbases and new taproot transactions. What will happen if such a computer ever exists is slowly attempts to mine the most static of these coins, probably the old coinbases, will occur. Once this happens everyone will know there is a quantum actor and avoid address reuse or in the worst case just move to a new address format. It's also important to remember that a quantum attack takes considerable time, not dissimilar to mining, as it's the process for searching for a private key. Another Algorithm, called grovers, will enable a new kind of mining ASIC, similar to how generations of PoW devices have always functioned.",

  "mstr": "MicroStrategy isn't bitcoin. Saylor encourages people to buy his stock instead of real bitcoin. Says Bitcoin isn't money and shouldn't be used as money. Says people shouldn't self custody. Says people should go into dangerous levels of debt and risk their entire lives by gambling on the top of markets - as he did last cycle when telling people to remortgage their homes at 64k. MicroStrategy is a product Saylor shills to enrich himself and gamble with other people's money.",
  "custody": "If you store bitcoin on an exchange or custodial platform, **you don't actually own ANY bitcoin**. Bitcoin belongs to the person that holds the digital cryptographic keys required to spend it. If you don't have a wallet app or hardware wallet that holds these keys, your custodian is the one who owns the bitcoin. You own an IOU, which can and WILL screw you over, like has happened many times before in the cases of Mt. Gox, FTX, and the like. Your custodian is not safe, your custodian will be hacked, your custodian will be coerced or pressured by governments, your custodian will side with profit in the case of forks. Protect yourself by holding your own keys.",
  "choosewallet": "Choosing the right wallet for you ultimately depends on your threat model. This scales with factors like if people know you hold bitcoin, if you're at risk for physical attacks, etc. but for most people, it mainly depends on how *much* bitcoin you hold, and what you plan to do with it. For small amounts you want readily available for spending, a hot wallet on an internet-connected device is often the most convenient-- but this also puts you at risk of being hacked. For large amounts you really can't afford to lose, an airgapped hardware wallet is often a better choice. In some cases, you might even want to setup multisig or more complex security systems.",
  "airgap": "An airgap describes a security system where your bitcoin keys are generated and stored on a device that has never been connected to the internet, and never will be. You will usually use such a device with an app on a phone or computer which allows you to construct a transaction, move it to the device, sign it on the device, and move it back to the app in order to broadcast it. This is often done by communicating to the device through an SD card or QR codes. An airgapped device is never *connected* wirelessly or with a wire, this would break the airgap. When done properly, an airgap protects you from *most* forms of hacking. You can DIY such a system, or get a suitable hardware wallet that supports it. See `!wallet airgap`.",
